pmfstat - PHP Usage Statistics Collector and Viewer
---------------------------------------------------

OpenSource developers often have a loose connection to their users. Often it
would be interesting to gather knowledge about the PHP configurations your
users are actually using to consider the impact when using specific features
of the PHP platform.

This projects holds some routines which are included in the phpMyFAQ installer,
a server component receiving data and an browser interface for viewing this
data.

This code was mostly written ad hoc and not for reusability.
